# Thymio - Dijkstra / A* Pathfinding

In the summer semester of 2016 I attended a basic robotics course. The goal was to send a small robot through a parkours using pathfinding algorithms. On top of handling the movement I implemented a GUI to visualize the movement of the robot, extended it to be almost infinitely scalable in the size of the parkours as well as being usable without the robot itself. The project was rewarded with an A+.

### Installation
* Download and import to Eclipse 
* Start Main.Controller as Applet

### Functionality

   - Many adjustments possible in the Settings Class
      - Colors
      - Images
      - Sizes
      - Dijkstra or A* Algorithm 
      - Display Labels for Costs
      - Display Colors for open/closed list
      - and more...
   - Creates a Parcours with random obstacles or imports a CSV
   - Control the Robot via W A S D
   - Start Path calculation with 'C'
